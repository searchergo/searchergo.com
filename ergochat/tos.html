    <h2>14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>14.1. These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of New Mexico, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

    </ol>

    <h2>16. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
    <p>16.1. You and ERGO LLC agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Service (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p>
    <p>16.2. The arbitration will be conducted in New Mexico, unless you and ERGO LLC agree otherwise. If the value of the relief sought is $1,000 or less, either you or ERGO LLC may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and ERGO LLC subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing.</p>
    <p>16.3. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $5,000 or less, the arbitrator must issue a decision within 90 days of the demand for arbitration being filed, and the arbitrator may only award individual relief and may not award any form of class, consolidated, or representative relief.</p>
    <p>16.4. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
    <p>16.5. You and ERGO LLC agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</p>
    <p>16.6. Unless both you and ERGO LLC agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

    <h2>17. Class Action Waiver</h2>
    <p>17.1. You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us individually. To the full extent permitted by law,</p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other;</li>
        <li>there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and</li>
        <li>there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>18. Severability</h2>
    <p>18.1. If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>19. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>19.1. These Terms, including any legal notices and disclaimers contained on this website, constitute the entire agreement between you and ERGO LLC in relation to your use of the Service, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings with respect to the same.</p>
    <p>19.2. You acknowledge that, in entering into this agreement, you do not rely on any representation, warranty, or other provision except as expressly provided in these Terms.</p>
