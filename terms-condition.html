        <h3 id="changes-to-these-terms">Changes to these Terms</h3>
        <p>
          The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these Terms
          at any time. In such cases, the Owner will appropriately inform the
          User of these changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User for the
          future.
        </p>

        <p>
          The continued use of the Service will signify the User’s acceptance of
          the revised Terms. If Users do not wish to be bound by the changes,
          they must stop using the Service. Failure to accept the revised Terms,
          may entitle either party to terminate the Agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to
          the User's acceptance. The User can obtain any previous version from
          the Owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          If required by applicable law, the Owner will specify the date by
          which the modified Terms will enter into force.
        </p>
        <h3 id="assignment-of-contract">Assignment of contract</h3>
        <p>
          The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by
          novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under these
          Terms, taking the User’s legitimate interests into account. Provisions
          regarding changes of these Terms will apply accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations under
          these Terms in any way, without the written permission of the Owner.
        </p>
        <h3 id="contacts">Contacts</h3>
        <p>
          All communications relating to the use of this Website must be sent
          using the contact information stated in this document.
        </p>
        <h3 id="severability">Severability</h3>
        <p>
          Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or
          unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability
          of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
          provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.
        </p>
        <h4 id="us-users">US Users</h4>
        <p>
          Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted,
          construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it
          valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent. These
          Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with
          respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other
          communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements,
          between the parties with respect to such subject matter. These Terms
          will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h4 id="eu-users">EU Users</h4>
        <p>
          Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or
          unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable
          way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby
          substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.<br />
          In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable
          provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions,
          if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the
          impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall
          not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are
          essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties
          would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the
          provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining
          provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the
          parties.
        </p>
        <h3 id="governing-law">Governing law</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is

          Consumer and has their habitual residence in a country where the law
          provides for a higher consumer protection standard, such higher
          standards shall prevail.

        <p>
          The exclusive competence to decide on any controversy resulting from
          or connected to these Terms lies with the courts of the place where
          the Owner is based, as displayed in the relevant section of this
          document.
